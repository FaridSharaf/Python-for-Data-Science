# Python-for-Data-Science

A playground for python data cleansing, transformation, and visualizing using Python. 
The main used libraries are: 
  - Pandas
  - numpy 
  - json
  - Plotly (visualisation)

The first three Tasks has Arabic walkthrough videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfzTCaaN3T5VKPkgYsno_7NL_uiAOkhoc) each one is less than two minutes. 
### Task 1 - Data Transformation and Cleaning with Pandas
-------------
[Description]

This task has some questions and 3 datasets:
  - Energy Indicators.xls
  - world_bank.csv
  - scimagojr-3.xlsx

Questions are concerned with: 
  - cleaning the data.
  - Doing some aggregations.
  - Merging some tables.
  - Calculate some requested statistics.

### Task 2 - Data Transformation and Cleaning with Pandas
                    
[Description]

This task is maintained to extract some information from shorted links JSON file provided by Bitly. 
the information to be extracted are: 
  - web_browser: The web browser that has requested the service
  - operating_sys: the operating system that initiated this request
  - from_url: The main URL the user came from
  - to_url: The same applied like `from_url`
  - city: The city from which the request was sent
  - longitude: The longitude where the request was sent
  - latitude: The latitude where the request was sent
  - time_zone: The time zone that the city follow
  - time_in: Time when the request started
  - time_out: Time when the request is ended.

Questions are concerned with: 
  - cleaning the data.
  - Extracting information from JSON file
A solved version for the task can be found [here](https://github.com/FaridSharaf/Python-for-Data-Science/blob/main/Task%202%20-%20USA.gov%20Data%20from%20Bitly/Task%202%20-%20USA.gov%20Data%20from%20Bitly.ipynb). 

A python script of the notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/FaridSharaf/Python-for-Data-Science/blob/main/Task%202%20-%20USA.gov%20Data%20from%20Bitly/%5BScript%5DTask%202%20-%20USA.gov%20Data%20from%20Bitly.py), the script takes a JSON file and parse it to a CSV file.

### Task 3 - Plotly
                    
[Description]

This task is about visualization using Plotly. 
It has 4 graphs that show the relationship between price and points in the Wine dataset. 

A solved version for the task can be found [here](https://github.com/FaridSharaf/Python-for-Data-Science/blob/main/Task%203%20-%20Plotly/plotly%20playground.ipynb).
